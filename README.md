# Ada-Boost
This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) in Python. The code demonstrates the core concepts of AdaBoost, including weak classifiers, weight updates, and ensemble prediction. It includes functions for data loading, stump classification, and the main AdaBoost algorithm.
